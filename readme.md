# Hi

recording my progress learning C++ ;3

I wanted to get into CP(Competitive ProgrammingðŸ˜ƒ) and C++ is a must for that :pensive:. I have already done basic C before so the syntax was not hard to get used to. i have broken down the things i want to learn into different sections and files. the files go like one.cpp then two.cpp then three.cpp and so on.

<h3>one.cpp</h3>
  <p align = "left">setting up C++. installing g++ and setting it up. </p>

<div align = "center"> 
<h3>two.cpp</h3>
  <p align = "left">
    Menu driven program to revisit the basics. This program includes review of basic syntax, data types and loops etc. Tried some C++ features(?) as well like vectors. Syntax is very similar to C, relatively little differences(as of now, atleast for the simple programsðŸ˜”). Loved the vector data structure AND THE STRING, so much easier and less of a pain to deal with than arrays in C.
